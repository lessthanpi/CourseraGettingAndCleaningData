# Coursera Getting And Cleaning Data

This is a repository for the files for the peer reviewed submission portion of the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data"
There is a file called run_analysis.R that downloads, merges, cleans, and ouputs a tidy dataset.
The output dataset is stored under "Final Tidy Data.txt"

I did my best to add a lot of descriptive comments in the R file.
